# ASGI Support

Often, you need not only to run your application to consume messages but also to make it a part of your service ecosystem with *Prometheus metrics*, K8S *liveness* and *readiness probes*, *traces*, and other observability features.

Unfortunately, such functionality can't be implemented by broker features alone, and you have to provide several **HTTP** endpoints in your app.

Of course, you can use **FastStream** as a part of any **ASGI** frameworks ([integrations](./integrations/frameworks/index.md){.internal-link}), but fewer the dependencies, the better, right?

## AsgiFastStream

Fortunately, we have built-in **ASGI** support. It is very limited but good enough to provide you with basic functionality for metrics and healthcheck endpoint implementation.

Let's take a look at the following example:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 5" title="main.py"
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.asgi import AsgiFastStream

broker = NatsBroker()
app = AsgiFastStream(broker)
```

This simple example allows you to run the app using regular **ASGI** servers:

```shell
uvicorn main:app
```

It does nothing but launch the app itself as an **ASGI lifespan**.

!!! note
    You are able to use something else than `uvicorn`.
    ```shell
    faststream run main:app --workers 4
    ```
    ```shell
    gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --workers=4
    ```
    ```shell
    granian --interface asgi main:app --workers 4
    ```
    ```shell
    hypercorn main:app --workers 4
    ```


### ASGI Routes

It doesn't look very helpful, so let's add some **HTTP** endpoints.

First, we have already written a wrapper on top of the broker to make a ready-to-use **ASGI** healthcheck endpoint for you:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 9"
{! docs_src/getting_started/asgi/healthcheck_app.py !}
```

!!! note
    This `/health` endpoint calls the `#!python broker.ping()` method and returns **HTTP 204** or **HTTP 500** statuses.

### Custom ASGI Routes

**AsgiFastStream** is able to call any **ASGI**-compatible callable objects, so you can use any endpoints from other libraries if they are compatible with the protocol.

If you want to write your own simple **HTTP**-endpoint, you can use our `#!python @get` or `#!python @post` decorator as in the following example.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 7-9 13""
{! docs_src/getting_started/asgi/custom_app.py !}
```

!!! tip
    You do not need to setup all routes using the `asgi_routes=[]` parameter.<br/>
    You can use the `#!python app.mount("/health", asgi_endpoint)` method also.

#### Accessing context fields

**HTTP** endpoints can receive arguments from the context, such as **App**, **Logger**, [**Context**](./context.md){.internal-link}, or **Request** objects.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 5-6 14"
{! docs_src/getting_started/asgi/logging_app.py !}
```

You can also use helper functions to access query parameters and headers:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 8-9 18"
{! docs_src/getting_started/asgi/auth_app.py !}
```

#### Dependency injection

Dependency Injection works with [**FastDepends**](https://lancetnik.github.io/FastDepends/){.external-link target="_blank"} in the same way as described in [Dependencies](./dependencies/index.md){.internal-link}.

!!! warning
    FastDepends DI and `Context` access will not work if you implement your own handlers instead using the `get` or `post` decorators.

### ASGI Documentation

By default, any ASGI routes will be added to your AsyncAPI documentation. If you wish to exclude these routes, just do the following:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
app = AsgiFastStream(
    broker,
    asgi_routes=[(
        "/health",
        make_ping_asgi(broker, timeout=5.0, include_in_schema=False)
    )]
)
```

Or, for custom ASGI routes:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
@get(include_in_schema=False)
async def liveness_ping(scope):
    return AsgiResponse(b"", status_code=200)

app = AsgiFastStream(
    broker,
    asgi_routes=[("/health", liveness_ping)]
)
```

### AsyncAPI Documentation

You can also host your **AsyncAPI** documentation in the same process, by running [`#!shell faststream docs serve ...`](./asyncapi/hosting.md){.internal-link}, in the same container and runtime.

Just create an `AsgiFastStream` object with a special option:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="10"
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.asgi import AsgiFastStream
from faststream.specification import AsyncAPI

broker = NatsBroker()

app = AsgiFastStream(
    broker,
    specification=AsyncAPI(),
    asyncapi_path="/docs/asyncapi",
)
```

Now, your **AsyncAPI HTML** representation can be found by the `/docs/asyncapi` url.

!!! note
    For extended examples on the **AsyncAPI** feature, see [Serving the AsyncAPI Documentation](./asyncapi/hosting.md){.internal-link} page.

### FastStream Object Reuse

You may also use regular `FastStream.as_asgi()` method for similar result.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 12"
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.specification import AsyncAPI
from faststream.asgi import make_ping_asgi, AsgiResponse, get

broker = NatsBroker()

@get
async def liveness_ping(scope):
    return AsgiResponse(b"", status_code=200)

app = FastStream(broker, specification=AsyncAPI()).as_asgi(
    asgi_routes=[
        ("/liveness", liveness_ping),
        ("/readiness", make_ping_asgi(broker, timeout=5.0)),
    ],
    asyncapi_path="/docs/asyncapi",
)
```

!!! tip
    For apps that use ASGI, you may use the CLI command just like for the default FastStream app

    ```shell
    faststream run main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
    ```
    This possibility built on gunicorn + uvicorn, you need install them to run FastStream ASGI app via CLI.
    We send all args directly to gunicorn, you can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/examples/example_config.py).

## Other ASGI Compatibility

Moreover, our wrappers can be used as ready-to-use endpoints for other **ASGI** frameworks. This can be very helpful When you are running **FastStream** in the same runtime as any other **ASGI** frameworks.

Just follow the following example in such cases:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="6 20-21"
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.specification import AsyncAPI
from faststream.asgi import make_ping_asgi, make_asyncapi_asgi

broker = NatsBroker()
asyncapi = AsyncAPI(broker)

@asynccontextmanager
async def start_broker(app):
    """Start the broker with the app."""
    async with broker:
        await broker.start()
        yield

app = FastAPI(lifespan=start_broker)

app.mount("/health", make_ping_asgi(broker, timeout=5.0))
app.mount("/asyncapi", make_asyncapi_asgi(asyncapi, try_it_out=False))
```
