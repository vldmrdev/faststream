        """Initialize KafkaBroker.

        Args:
            bootstrap_servers: A `host[:port]` string (or list of `host[:port]` strings) that the consumer should contact to bootstrap
                initial cluster metadata.

                This does not have to be the full node list.
                It just needs to have at least one broker that will respond to a
                Metadata API Request. Default port is 9092.
            request_timeout_ms: Client request timeout in milliseconds.
            retry_backoff_ms: Milliseconds to backoff when retrying on errors.
            metadata_max_age_ms: The period of time in milliseconds after
                which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any
                partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new
                brokers or partitions.
            connections_max_idle_ms: Close idle connections after the number
                of milliseconds specified by this config. Specifying `None` will
                disable idle checks.
            client_id: A name for this client. This string is passed in
                each request to servers and can be used to identify specific
                server-side log entries that correspond to this client. Also
                submitted to :class:`~.consumer.group_coordinator.GroupCoordinator`
                for logging with respect to consumer group administration.
            allow_auto_create_topics: Allow automatic topic creation on the broker when subscribing to or assigning non-existent topics.
            config: Extra configuration for the confluent-kafka-python
                producer/consumer. See `confluent_kafka.Config <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/html/index.html#kafka-client-configuration>`_.
            acks: One of ``0``, ``1``, ``all``. The number of acknowledgments
                the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a
                request complete. This controls the durability of records that are
                sent. The following settings are common:

                * ``0``: Producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server
                  at all. The message will immediately be added to the socket
                  buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the
                  server has received the record in this case, and the retries
                  configuration will not take effect (as the client won't
                  generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each
                  record will always be set to -1.
                * ``1``: The broker leader will write the record to its local log but
                  will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all
                  followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately
                  after acknowledging the record but before the followers have
                  replicated it then the record will be lost.
                * ``all``: The broker leader will wait for the full set of in-sync
                  replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the
                  record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
                  remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.

                If unset, defaults to ``acks=1``. If `enable_idempotence` is
                :data:`True` defaults to ``acks=all``.
            compression_type: The compression type for all data generated bythe producer.
                Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching
                will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better
                compression).
            partitioner: Callable used to determine which partition
                each message is assigned to. Called (after key serialization):
                ``partitioner(key_bytes, all_partitions, available_partitions)``.
                The default partitioner implementation hashes each non-None key
                using the same murmur2 algorithm as the Java client so that
                messages with the same key are assigned to the same partition.
                When a key is :data:`None`, the message is delivered to a random partition
                (filtered to partitions with available leaders only, if possible).
            max_request_size: The maximum size of a request. This is also
                effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server
                has its own cap on record size which may be different from this.
                This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer
                will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests.
            linger_ms: The producer groups together any records that arrive
                in between request transmissions into a single batched request.
                Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster
                than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client
                may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load.
                This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of
                artificial delay; that is, if first request is processed faster,
                than `linger_ms`, producer will wait ``linger_ms - process_time``.
            enable_idempotence: When set to `True`, the producer will
                ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the
                stream. If `False`, producer retries due to broker failures,
                etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream.
                Note that enabling idempotence acks to set to ``all``. If it is not
                explicitly set by the user it will be chosen.
            transactional_id: Transactional ID for the producer.
            transaction_timeout_ms: Transaction timeout in milliseconds.
            graceful_timeout: Graceful shutdown timeout. Broker waits for all running subscribers completion before shut down.
            ack_policy: Default acknowledgement policy for all subscribers. Individual subscribers can override.
            decoder: Custom decoder object.
            parser: Custom parser object.
            dependencies: Dependencies to apply to all broker subscribers.
            middlewares: Middlewares to apply to all broker publishers/subscribers.
            routers: Routers to apply to broker.
            security: Security options to connect broker and generate AsyncAPI server security information.
            specification_url: AsyncAPI hardcoded server addresses. Use `servers` if not specified.
            protocol: AsyncAPI server protocol.
            protocol_version: AsyncAPI server protocol version.
            description: AsyncAPI server description.
            tags: AsyncAPI server tags.
            logger: User specified logger to pass into Context and log service messages.
            log_level: Service messages log level.
            apply_types: Whether to use FastDepends or not.
            serializer: Serializer for FastDepends.
            provider: Provider for FastDepends.
            context: Context for FastDepends.
