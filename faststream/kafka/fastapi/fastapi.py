        """FastAPI router for Kafka broker.

        Args:
            bootstrap_servers: A `host[:port]` string (or list of `host[:port]` strings) that the consumer should contact to bootstrap
                initial cluster metadata.
                This does not have to be the full node list.
                It just needs to have at least one broker that will respond to a
                Metadata API Request. Default port is 9092.
            request_timeout_ms: Client request timeout in milliseconds.
            retry_backoff_ms: Milliseconds to backoff when retrying on errors.
            metadata_max_age_ms: The period of time in milliseconds after
                which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any
                partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new
                brokers or partitions.
            connections_max_idle_ms: Close idle connections after the number
                of milliseconds specified by this config. Specifying `None` will
                disable idle checks.
            sasl_oauth_token_provider: OAuthBearer token provider instance
            client_id: A name for this client. This string is passed in
                each request to servers and can be used to identify specific
                server-side log entries that correspond to this client. Also
                submitted to :class:`~.consumer.group_coordinator.GroupCoordinator`
                for logging with respect to consumer group administration.
            # publisher args
            acks: One of ``0``, ``1``, ``all``. The number of acknowledgments
                the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a
                request complete. This controls the durability of records that are
                sent. The following settings are common:
                * ``0``: Producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server
                    at all. The message will immediately be added to the socket
                    buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the
                    server has received the record in this case, and the retries
                    configuration will not take effect (as the client won't
                    generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each
                    record will always be set to -1.
                * ``1``: The broker leader will write the record to its local log but
                    will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all
                    followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately
                    after acknowledging the record but before the followers have
                    replicated it then the record will be lost.
                * ``all``: The broker leader will wait for the full set of in-sync
                    replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the
                    record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
                    remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.
                If unset, defaults to ``acks=1``. If `enable_idempotence` is
                :data:`True` defaults to ``acks=all``.
            key_serializer: Used to convert user-supplied keys to bytes.
            value_serializer: Used to convert user-supplied message values to bytes.
            compression_type:  The compression type for all data generated bythe producer.
                Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching
                will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better
                compression).
            max_batch_size: Maximum size of buffered data per partition.
                After this amount `send` coroutine will block until batch is drained.
            partitioner: Callable used to determine which partition
                each message is assigned to. Called (after key serialization):
                ``partitioner(key_bytes, all_partitions, available_partitions)``.
                The default partitioner implementation hashes each non-None key
                using the same murmur2 algorithm as the Java client so that
                messages with the same key are assigned to the same partition.
                When a key is :data:`None`, the message is delivered to a random partition
                (filtered to partitions with available leaders only, if possible).
            max_request_size: The maximum size of a request. This is also
                effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server
                has its own cap on record size which may be different from this.
                This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer
                will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests.
            linger_ms: The producer groups together any records that arrive
                in between request transmissions into a single batched request.
                Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster
                than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client
                may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load.
                This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of
                artificial delay; that is, if first request is processed faster,
                than `linger_ms`, producer will wait ``linger_ms - process_time``.
            enable_idempotence: When set to `True`, the producer will
                ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the
                stream. If `False`, producer retries due to broker failures,
                etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream.
                Note that enabling idempotence acks to set to ``all``. If it is not
                explicitly set by the user it will be chosen.

        """Create a subscriber for Kafka topics.

        Args:
            *topics: Kafka topics to consume messages from.
            batch: Whether to consume messages in batches or not.
            group_id:
                Name of the consumer group to join for dynamic
                partition assignment (if enabled), and to use for fetching and
                committing offsets. If `None`, auto-partition assignment (via
                group coordinator) and offset commits are disabled.
            group_instance_id:
                Name of the group instance ID used for static
                membership (KIP-345). If set, the consumer is treated as a
                static member, which means it does not join/leave the group
                on each restart, avoiding unnecessary rebalances.
            key_deserializer:
                Any callable that takes a raw message `bytes`
                key and returns a deserialized one.
            value_deserializer:
                Any callable that takes a raw message `bytes`
                value and returns a deserialized value.
            fetch_max_bytes:
                The maximum amount of data the server should
                return for a fetch request. This is not an absolute maximum, if
                the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch
                is larger than this value, the message will still be returned
                to ensure that the consumer can make progress. NOTE: consumer
                performs fetches to multiple brokers in parallel so memory
                usage will depend on the number of brokers containing
                partitions for the topic.
            fetch_min_bytes:
                Minimum amount of data the server should
                return for a fetch request, otherwise wait up to
                `fetch_max_wait_ms` for more data to accumulate.
            fetch_max_wait_ms:
                The maximum amount of time in milliseconds
                the server will block before answering the fetch request if
                there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy the
                requirement given by `fetch_min_bytes`.
            max_partition_fetch_bytes:
                The maximum amount of data
                per-partition the server will return. The maximum total memory
                used for a request ``= #partitions * max_partition_fetch_bytes``.
                This size must be at least as large as the maximum message size
                the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to
                send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. If that
                happens, the consumer can get stuck trying to fetch a large
                message on a certain partition.
            auto_offset_reset:
                A policy for resetting offsets on `OffsetOutOfRangeError` errors:

                * `earliest` will move to the oldest available message
                * `latest` will move to the most recent
                * `none` will raise an exception so you can handle this case
            auto_commit:
                If `True` the consumer's offset will be
                periodically committed in the background.

            auto_commit_interval_ms:
                Milliseconds between automatic
                offset commits, if `auto_commit` is `True`.
            check_crcs:
                Automatically check the CRC32 of the records
                consumed. This ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to
                the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so it may
                be disabled in cases seeking extreme performance.
            partition_assignment_strategy:
                List of objects to use to
                distribute partition ownership amongst consumer instances when
                group management is used. This preference is implicit in the order
                of the strategies in the list. When assignment strategy changes:
                to support a change to the assignment strategy, new versions must
                enable support both for the old assignment strategy and the new
                one. The coordinator will choose the old assignment strategy until
                all members have been updated. Then it will choose the new
                strategy.
            max_poll_interval_ms:
                Maximum allowed time between calls to
                consume messages in batches. If this interval
                is exceeded the consumer is considered failed and the group will
                rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another consumer
                group member. If API methods block waiting for messages, that time
                does not count against this timeout.
            rebalance_timeout_ms:
                The maximum time server will wait for this
                consumer to rejoin the group in a case of rebalance. In Java client
                this behaviour is bound to `max.poll.interval.ms` configuration,
                but as ``aiokafka`` will rejoin the group in the background, we
                decouple this setting to allow finer tuning by users that use
                `ConsumerRebalanceListener` to delay rebalacing. Defaults
                to ``session_timeout_ms``
            session_timeout_ms:
                Client group session and failure detection
                timeout. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats
                (`heartbeat.interval.ms`) to indicate its liveness to the broker.
                If no hearts are received by the broker for a group member within
                the session timeout, the broker will remove the consumer from the
                group and trigger a rebalance. The allowed range is configured with
                the **broker** configuration properties
                `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`.
            heartbeat_interval_ms:
                The expected time in milliseconds
                between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using
                Kafka's group management feature. Heartbeats are used to ensure
                that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate
                rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The
                value must be set lower than `session_timeout_ms`, but typically
                should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be
                adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal
                rebalances.
            consumer_timeout_ms:
                Maximum wait timeout for background fetching
                routine. Mostly defines how fast the system will see rebalance and
                request new data for new partitions.
            max_poll_records:
                The maximum number of records returned in a
                single call by batch consumer. Has no limit by default.
            exclude_internal_topics:
                Whether records from internal topics
                (such as offsets) should be exposed to the consumer. If set to True
                the only way to receive records from an internal topic is
                subscribing to it.
            isolation_level:
                Controls how to read messages written
                transactionally.

                * `read_committed`, batch consumer will only return
                transactional messages which have been committed.

                * `read_uncommitted` (the default), batch consumer will
                return all messages, even transactional messages which have been
                aborted.

                Non-transactional messages will be returned unconditionally in
                either mode.

                Messages will always be returned in offset order. Hence, in
                `read_committed` mode, batch consumer will only return
                messages up to the last stable offset (ALSO), which is the one less
                than the offset of the first open transaction. In particular any
                messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions
                will be withheld until the relevant transaction has been completed.
                As a result, `read_committed` consumers will not be able to read up
                to the high watermark when there are in flight transactions.
                Further, when in `read_committed` the seek_to_end method will
                return the ALSO. See method docs below.
            batch_timeout_ms:
                Milliseconds spent waiting if
                data is not available in the buffer. If 0, returns immediately
                with any records that are available currently in the buffer,
                else returns empty.
            max_records: Number of messages to consume as one batch.
            listener:
                Optionally include listener
                callback, which will be called before and after each rebalance
                operation.
                As part of group management, the consumer will keep track of
                the list of consumers that belong to a particular group and
                will trigger a rebalance operation if one of the following
                events trigger:

                * Number of partitions change for any of the subscribed topics
                * Topic is created or deleted
                * An existing member of the consumer group dies
                * A new member is added to the consumer group

                When any of these events are triggered, the provided listener
                will be invoked first to indicate that the consumer's
                assignment has been revoked, and then again when the new
                assignment has been received. Note that this listener will
                immediately override any listener set in a previous call
                to subscribe. It is guaranteed, however, that the partitions
                revoked/assigned
                through this interface are from topics subscribed in this call.
            pattern:
                Pattern to match available topics. You must provide either topics or pattern, but not both.
            partitions:  An explicit partitions list to assign.
                You can't use 'topics' and 'partitions' in the same time.
            dependencies: Dependencies list (`[Dependant(),]`) to apply to the subscriber.
            parser: Parser to map original **ConsumerRecord** object to FastStream one.
            decoder: Function to decode FastStream msg bytes body to python objects.
            middlewares: Subscriber middlewares to wrap incoming message processing.
            max_workers: Number of workers to process messages concurrently.
            no_ack: Whether to disable **FastStream** auto acknowledgement logic or not.
            ack_policy: Acknowledgement policy for the subscriber.
            no_reply: Whether to disable **FastStream** RPC and Reply To auto responses or not.
            title: Specification subscriber object title.
            description: Specification subscriber object description. " "Uses decorated docstring as default.
            include_in_schema: Whetever to include operation in Specification schema or not.
            response_model: The type to use for the response.
                It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                etc.
                It will be used for:
                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.

            response_model_exclude_unset: Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data
                should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and
                have their default values. This is different from
                `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set,
                they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same
                as the default.
                When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

            response_model_exclude_defaults: Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data
                should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value
                as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset`
                in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values,
                they will be excluded from the response.

            response_model_exclude_none:  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should
                exclude fields set to `None`.
                This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset`
                and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of
                those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values
                when it makes sense.
